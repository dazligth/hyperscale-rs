//! Settled-waves window request for the split-boundary fence.
//!
//! After a shard `P` terminates at a split, a surviving counterpart must
//! decide, for any cross-shard wave still referencing `P`, whether `P`
//! actually settled that wave in its chain at or before the terminal block
//! `B`. It reads `P`'s beacon-attested `settled_waves_root` from its own
//! fold and fetches the whole window settled-wave list in one shot: the
//! complete set `S_P` of the **cross-shard** waves `P` settled over
//! `[B − RETENTION_HORIZON, B]` (single-shard waves are never queried, so
//! they are excluded). The requester accepts the list iff its recomputed
//! root equals the attested one, so a withheld wave changes the root and the
//! absence of any wave from the verified-complete set is sound (see
//! [`GetSettledWavesResponse`]).
