//! Dispatch trait for scheduling work across priority-isolated pools.
//!
//! This crate defines the [`Dispatch`] trait used by runners to schedule
//! CPU-intensive work (crypto verification, transaction execution, codec).
//!
//! Dispatch is an implementation detail of runners, not the state machine.
//! The state machine emits `Action` variants; runners use a `Dispatch`
//! implementation to schedule the corresponding work:
//!
//! - [`SyncDispatch`](https://docs.rs/hyperscale-dispatch-sync) runs closures inline (deterministic simulation)
//! - [`PooledDispatch`](https://docs.rs/hyperscale-dispatch-pooled) uses rayon thread pools (production)
//!
//! # Pool Categories
//!
//! Three routing classes:
//!
//! - **Consensus**: liveness-critical work (block votes, QC verification,
//!   state root, proposal building). Routes to a small dedicated pool so
//!   long execution batches can't queue ahead of it.
//! - **Throughput**: throughput-bound CPU work — general crypto
//!   verification, transaction signature validation, Radix Engine
//!   execution. Routes to one shared work-stealing pool; in-handler
//!   `par_iter` fans batches across the whole pool's workers.
//! - **I/O**: network sends, filesystem, GC. Routes to tokio.

/// Routing class for [`Dispatch::spawn`]. Production runners use this to
/// pick the right rayon pool (or tokio for I/O); simulation runners ignore
/// it and run every closure inline.
